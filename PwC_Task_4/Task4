Number of Male = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT('Pharma Group AG'[Employee ID]),FILTER('Pharma Group AG','Pharma Group AG'[Gender]="Male"))

% of Male = DIVIDE('Pharma Group AG'[Number of Male],'Pharma Group AG'[Number of Male]+'Pharma Group AG'[Number of Female])

% of Female = DIVIDE('Pharma Group AG'[Number of Female],'Pharma Group AG'[Number of Male]+'Pharma Group AG'[Number of Female])

Avg Male Rating: CALCULATE(AVERAGE('Pharma Group AG'[FY20 Performance Rating]),FILTER('Pharma Group AG','Pharma Group AG'[Gender] = "Male"))
